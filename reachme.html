<h4 class="Gender Equality">  </h4>

<P class="para1">G E N D E R  E Q U A L I T Y, yes you heard it right, this article is about gender equality. When we hear about it I am sure most of the people here would have taught about women not having enough freedom. Sometimes it's not about laws it's about the thinking we have, we have always thought that women were not having enough freedom but that thought covers our eyes and we don't see the opportunities ahead. So lets open our eyes and grab the oppurtunities</p>

<div id="content2"> 
<h4 class="Take a look at yourself">  </h4>
<P class="para1">There is always that one person in your group who always talk postive and I am sure you must have got pissed of at them for always talking like that without knowing your situation but give it a taught again what they tell turns out to be real so think of me to be that PeRSoN and believe if anyone tells you not do something with regard to gender dont believe them, take a look at yourself smile and start the day ahead good luck</p>
